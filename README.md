### Time Series Forecasting of Flight Passengers Using ARIMA and SARIMAX

### Short Description:
This project focuses on forecasting flight passenger numbers using ARIMA and SARIMAX models. Since the dataset was initially non-stationary, we applied differencing and verified stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. We also analyzed the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots to determine the appropriate parameters for the models. Predictions were made for test data, inline forecasting, and additional sample forecasting using SARIMAX. Various visualizations and statistical checks were conducted to analyze trends and seasonality.

### Results:

a. ARIMA performed better in terms of lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), making it more accurate for short-term forecasting.

b. SARIMAX was superior in terms of lower Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), making it more efficient for long-term forecasting.

c. ACF and PACF plots helped in selecting optimal parameters for ARIMA and SARIMAX, improving model performance.
